They went through the loud crowd shouting in excitement for the second part of the game and managed to get back just in time for the start. However, {alexia.character()}’s and {character()}’s food didn’t survive the trip as they dropped it on the floor while trying to sit down, and unfortunately landed on {yuyue.character()}’s and Bob’s clothes. {luca.character()} suggested that there’s no time to go back to the bathroom and asked {rachna.character()} if she has any tissues to give. {rachna.character()} nodded in agreement as she reached out to her purse.

MOVE THERE’S AN AMBULANCE BEHIND US” {yuyue.character()} shouted but couldn’t see the {character()} and {alexia.character()} anywhere. “I should call {jelle.character()} or {rachna.character()}” they thought. As they pulled out their phone, someone running from beehind pushed {yuyue.character()}’s hand making them dropped it to the ground. As they kneeled to pick it up, they saw {luca.character()}’s hand trying to help. Both of them became falsely hopeful that they would reunite with the rest of the group, however the ambulance that now was even closer, forced them to go in different directions. None knew where everyone was. ")
